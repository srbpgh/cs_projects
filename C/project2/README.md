This project consisted of two programs.  The Expand program altered any line or file passed into it so that any sort of
whitespace was replaced with spaces.  The lengthcheck program checked each line or file passed into it to ensure that none were longer than
80 characters.  To be accurate, lengthcheck needed to be combined with expand.
